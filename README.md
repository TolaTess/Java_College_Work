Java work - Stack ADT, Queue ADT, Linked List, ArrayList, GUI etc

<h3>GUISample</h3>

This application is a simple exercise to use GUI interface.

Objective:

This application’s aim is to add, remove, search and sort names added in the GUI interface.

This application’s Graphical User Interface is as shown below.

<h3>JavaStack_Sample</h3>

A simple exercise using Stack Abstract Data Type. 

Objective:

The objective of this application is to use push(), pop(), isEmpty(), size() and displayStack to add, remove, check if stack is empty, check size of the stack and display all items added to the stack. 

A java interface, java class and a main class was used to execute these methods:
    
        public boolean isEmpty();
        public boolean isFull();
        public void push(Object newItem);
        public Object pop();
        public String displayStack();
        public String peek();
        public int size();
        public String emptyStack();
        
<h3>JavaQueue_Sample</h3>

A simple application using Queue Abstract Data Type. 

Objective:

The objective of this application is to use enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty(), size() and displayQueue to add, remove, check if queue is empty, check size of the queue and display all items added to the queue. 

A java interface, java class and a main class was used to execute these methods: 
   
         public boolean isEmpty();
         public int size();
         public Object front();
         public void enqueue(Object element);
         public Object dequeue();
         public String displayQueue();
         
<h3>Linked_List_ADT</h3>

This exercise looks at Single Linked List Abstract data type.

Objective:

The objective of this application is to create a single linked list data structure by implementing a Node class (Node), Java Interface (LinearList), Java Class (SLList) and a main class (SingleLinkedListApp).

How it works:
This application simply takes in data using the below methods:

	public boolean isEmpty();
	public int size();
	public Object get(int index);
	public void remove(int index);
	public void add(int index, Object theElement);
	public void printList();
  
<h3>Medical_Queue_ADT</h3>

An application for Patients to enter details to see a Doctor.

Objective:

The objective of this application is for Patients to book an appointment with the doctor by entering their Full Name and Symptoms. In addition, the application present a Doctor ’s view, where Doctors can view Patients in the queue and call the next Patient until the Queue is empty.  

<!--This application’s Graphical User Interface is as shown below:-->

<h3>Factiorial_Example</h3>

Simple codes outlining how to implement recursion.

<h3>Tree_Example</h3>

Simple codes outlining how to implement tree ADT

<h3>ArrayList_PriorityQueue</h3>

An application to priorities Patients based on severity of the injury.

Objective:

The objective of this application is to priorities patients on a queue based on the injury proirity number.
